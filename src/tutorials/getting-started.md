# Getting Started

## What’s in the box
Weclome! Let’s start by looking at what you have in the box:

![Whats in the box]   

    QUIRKBOT: Programmable toy that connects to electronics and Strawbees
    SERVO BACKPACK: For connecting the Servo Motor to the Quirkbot
    SERVO MOTOR: This motor can move 160 degrees
    2-COLOR LEDs: Lights with 2 colors that you can attach to the Quirkbot
    LIGHT SENSOR: Sensing light for fun interaction
    STRAWBEES: For building structures with drinking straws and carboard.
    DRINKING STRAWS: Building material
    USB CABLE: For charging and programming

All the different parts of the Quirkbot it self has names check out: [the Anatomy of the Quirkbot](https://github.com/kristoferhagbard/QbDoc/blob/master/Hardware/Quirkbot_anatomy.pdf) to learn what they are.


## Build something!

Quirkbot makes it easy to make Strawbees move. A great way to get started is to just start building!

    Tools needed: Sissors and a small phillips scewdriver

To first get started with Strawbees there is a [great guide](http://www.strawbees.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/booklet_a4_small.pdf) that you also can download.

To make strawbees move you dont't have to program anything right now. Just switch on the Quirkbot, Plug in the motor and use the program that comes preloaded:

#### 1. Switch On the Quirkbot:

#### 5. Tips and trix to make your building more fun

- **Attach a Strawbee to your motor:** Snap on a strawbee on the back of your Servo Motors arm, like this:

![Strawbee to Motor]

- **Building a motor mount:** There are many ways to connect a Servo motor to Strawbees. Check out these discriptions for [building motor mounts]() *coming soon* Here is also a simple type of motor mount you can build:

![Build motor mount]

- **The straw *secures* the motor arm:** When putting a straw on the Strawbee on the servo motor arm, make sure to slide it over both the Strawbee *and* the motor arm itself, like this:

![Secure motor arm]

- **Use other materials than straws:** Cardboard, Paper, Tape, Rubberbands, Aluinum foil and other light materials

- **Remember:** The Quirkbot Arms, Legs and Horn can be used to connect drinking straws, Just like Strawbees.

- **Inspiration:** To get some examples and inspiration for stuff to build chek out [#quirkbot on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quirkbot/).

#### When the Quirkbot runs out of battery you need to charge it:
