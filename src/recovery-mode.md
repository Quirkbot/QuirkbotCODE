# Recovery Mode
If your Quirkbot has stopped working and is not being detected anymore, you should enable *Recovery Mode*. While on *Recovery Mode*, the Quirkbot should be detectable again, allowing you to upload new code to it.

## Enabling Recovery Mode

1. Make sure [*Google Chrome* is up to date](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414){:target="_blank"}.
2. Make sure [*Quirkbot for Chrome* is installed and up to date](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quirkbot-for-chrome/ackaalhbfjagidmjlhlokoblhbnahegd){:target="_blank"}.
3. Connect your Quirkbot to a working USB port.
4. Turn your Quirkbot ON.
5. Using a jumper wire, quickly connect the **Reset Pin** (â†º) to the **Right Eye** (Quirkbot's perspective).
6. The the two **Mouth LEDs** should blink, confirming you have enabled *Recovery Mode*.
7. Your Quirkbot should now be detectable again, allowing you to upload programs.

*If your Quirkbot is still not detected even on Recovery Mode, please try to use a different USB cable and a different USB port. If the problem persists, please make bug report on the [forum](http://forurm.quirkbot.com).*
