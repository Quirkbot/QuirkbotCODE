# Recovery Mode
If you are seeing the "No Quirkbots Detected" message when trying to upload code to your Quirkbot, you may need to enable *Recovery Mode*.

## Enabling Recovery Mode

1. Connect your Quirkbot to a working USB port.
2. Turn your Quirkbot ON.
3. Using a jumper wire, quickly connect the **Reset Pin** (â†º) to the **Right Eye** (Quirkbot's perspective).
4. The the two **Mouth LEDs** should blink, confirming you have enabled *Recovery Mode*.
5. Your Quirkbot should now be detectable again, allowing you to upload programs.

*If your Quirkbot is still not detected even on Recovery Mode, please try to use a different USB cable and a different USB port. If the problem persists, please make bug report on the [forum](http://forurm.quirkbot.com).*

## Resetting to the factory program
To re-upload the original program that your Quirkbot came with, click on the button bellow.
