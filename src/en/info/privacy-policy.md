# Strawbees CODE's Privacy Policy

*We made Strawbees CODE (for now on referred as "platform") so anyone can program their Quirkbots easily. We understand how important privacy is to our community, especially kids and parents. We wrote this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect, how we use it and what we're doing to keep it safe.*

We may change this Policy from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you're happy with any changes. When the changes to this Policy regards how we handle your personal information (this only applies for registered users), you will be informed via email and will be required to review them before you can continue using the platform.

Any questions regarding this Policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to info@strawbees.com or by writing to Strawbees AB, Stenkolsgatan 1B, 417 07 Gothenburg, Sweden.

## Who are we?

We are Strawbees AB (for now on referred as "Strawbees", "we", "us" or "our"), a company that provide solutions for developing a powerful skillset through hands-on exploration and working with design, construction, electronics and programming.

Our organization number is 556983-8914 and we are registered under the address Strawbees AB, Stenkolsgatan 1B, 417 07 Gothenburg, Sweden.

## What personal information do we collect about you?

### You don't have to share any personal information with us:
It's important that you understand that you don't have to share any personal information with us if you don't want to. *You can use the platform to program your Quirkbots completely anonymously*.

As an anonymous user you are able to open, create and upload programs to your Quirkbot without the need to share any personal information with us.

However if you wish to save your programs online, you will need to create an account, and for that we will need access to some (minimal) personal information from you.

### Personal information is only required in case you want to save your programs online:
In order to save programs online, you will need to create an account.

During the account creation, we collect the minimum personal information we need in order to make the process technically viable. The information is only stored if you explicitly consent us to do so.

We collect your **username** (but explicitly state that it cannot include your real name or any other information that could personally identify you), a **password** (stored encrypted, using international industry standards) and an **email address** (used solely for communication regarding your account).

When you save your programs online, we store the **source code** of those programs too.

**Your username and all saved programs are public and anyone can access them online.**

Your email can only be accessed by you and our technical team.

### Cookies and other local storage technologies (cookie policy):
Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely identify your browser or device. The local storage (Local Storage, Session Storage, Indexed DB and WebSQL) is a space to save arbitrary data *locally on your browser*. **We don't store cookies but we store information in the local storage of your browser.**

We will use the local storage to store essential information that allows Strawbees CODE to function correctly. This information are the programs you are currently editing and interface settings. If you have an account on the platform we will also store authentication tokens that allows us to verify that you are logged in.

Before using Strawbees CODE for the first time, you will need to explicitly consent that we can use the local storage of your browser to store essential data. If you do not explicitly consent it, you will not be able to use the platform at all as it will not be able work correctly, technically speaking.

When you create an account, you will need to explicitly consent that we can use the local storage of your browser to store authentication data. If you do not explicitly consent it, you will not be able to create an account.

The information in your local storage will be stored indefinitely, until the storage is cleared. You have full control over it, and can clear it at any time by clicking on the button "Clear my Local Storage" on the start page or on your profile page or by clearing your browser storage. By clicking on the "Clear my Local Storage" button, you are also withdrawing your consent that we can store data on your local storage. If you have a registered account you can only fully withdraw your consent by deleting your account, you can do that by following the instructions on the section "How can you delete your information?" below.

## How do we use your information?

* **Email**: We will use your registered email to send necessary transactional messages exclusively regarding your account and updates to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. If you forget your password, we will ask you to disclose to us your email address so that we can send you a password reset code. As these emails are fundamental to the inner workings of Strawbees CODE you can only un-subscribe from them by deleting your account. We will not use your email to send you any marketing information.

* **Username**: We store your username (that cannot contain any information that could personally identify you) in order for you to be able to login and in order for you easily access all your programs at your profile page. The profile page is an unique URL that lists all your programs at once.

* **Encrypted password**: We store an encrypted version of you password in order to verify that you have access to your account.

* **Saved programs**: We save your programs so that you and other users can access them from anywhere.

* We will never share personally identifiable information about you with any other person, company, or organization, except:
	* As required to comply with our obligations under the law.
	* For technical reasons, if we are required to transfer the data to another location or organization.


## For how long do we store your information?
Your information will be stored for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, all your stored information (username, email, encrypted password and programs) will be deleted permanently.

If an account has not confirmed the email address or has not saved any programs in the last one year it will be considered inactive and will be deleted permanently and without any notice.

## How can you update your information?
If you would like to update your username or email, you can delete your account (via the "Delete my account" button on your profile page) and create a new one with the updated information at any moment.

If you would like to update your password, follow the password reset process on the login page.

You can edit or delete your programs directly from your profile page.

## How can you delete your information?
At any moment, you can simply click on the button "Delete my account" on your profile page and all your stored information (username, email, encrypted password and programs) will be deleted instantly and permanently.

## How can you access all your stored information?
At any moment, you can simply click on the button "Export my data", to download all your stored information (username, email, encrypted password and programs) in a machine readable format.

## Who actually stores your information?
As a *data controller*, we do not store your personal data directly on our premises. Instead your data is stored on our behalf by our *data processors* in servers managed by them.

We have agreements (Data Processing Addendum) with our data processors and all of them are compliant with GDPR:

- Amazon Web Services, Inc (AWS) - Seattle, United States
- International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) - New York, United States
- The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp (MailChimp) - Georgia, United States

## How do we protect your personal information?
As a data controller we strictly limit individual access of our employees to the data servers and all those employees have signed NDAs that do not allow them to disclose any of your personal data.

Our services that handle your personal data were designed with security in mind by implementing international industry standards for authentication and encrypting.

All data communication between your browser and the severs happens over HTTPS, meaning that even if that information was intercepted by someone (man-in-the-middle), it would not be able to be decoded.

You personal data is stored only by our data processors and we do not keep copies of it in our premises. The data processors are well stablished, global companies and all of them  have international industry standard security policies in place. You can read about how they deal with data security here:
- AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/security/)
- IBM (https://www.ibm.com/cloud/security)
- Mailchimp (https://mailchimp.com/about/security/)

However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot completely guarantee the security of the databases.
